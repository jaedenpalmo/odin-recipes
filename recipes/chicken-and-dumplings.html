    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic comfort food, this homemade chicken and dumpling soup is hearty and full of vegetables. It's the perfect meal for a cold day.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 celery ribs, diced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons chicken bouillon paste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried sage</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Dumplings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add oil. Once hot, add celery, carrots and onion and sauté for 3 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for 30 seconds. Add butter and flour and whisk well for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Gradually stir in the chicken broth and bouillon, scraping up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Add thyme, sage, rosemary, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and bring mixture to a boil. Cover the pot with a lid, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Remove chicken to a cutting board and rest for 5 minutes before chopping or shredding into small pieces. Return chicken to the pot and add evaporated milk and peas.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, sour cream and melted butter. Stir until combined, but don't over mix.</li>
        <li>Bring soup to a simmer and then use a small spoon to drop teaspoon-sized amounts of dough all over the top of the simmering soup (the dumplings will double in size as they cook).</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and simmer on low for 12-15 minutes. Remove lid, gently stir to break dumplings apart, and scoop out a dumpling to check for doneness. If still doughy, cover and cook for a few more minutes, until tender. Taste and adjust seasonings if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
